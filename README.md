# Document Analysis using OpenShift AI and Azure
The objective of this demo is to showcase how OpenShift AI and Azure components can be effectively integrated to implement a GenAI use case for document classification and analysis. By following the step-by-step guide, users will learn how to deploy an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) cluster and configure AI resources. This demo highlights the seamless collaboration between OpenShift AIâ€™s orchestration capabilities and Azure's powerful AI tools to create a scalable and secure solution for real-world AI applications.

Involving - 
1. Data Exploration - Explore data used in this repo.
2. Get Embeddings - Generate embeddings from documents using DISTILBERT model deployed on Openshift AI (https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english).
3. Classify Documents - Use DISTILBERT to classify documents into different categories.
4. Extract Key Information - Identify key information in documents using DISTILBERT.
5. Extract Key Words - Extract important words from documents using DISTILBERT.

## BBC News Articles Analysis
This project is a data analysis of the BBC news dataset. The goal of this project is to explore the data and classify documents into categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the BBC News Archive available from kaggle. It contains 2225 articles from the BBC news website with 5 different categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport and tech. Each article has a category, filename, title and text.

## Language Model
Examples in this repo uses DISTILBERT model (https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) which is deployed on Openshift AI.

## Notebooks
This project consists of notebooks that perform the following tasks:

[00-explore-data.ipynb](https://github.com/RHEcosystemAppEng/genai-document-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/00-explore-data.ipynb) - This notebook explores the data by looking at the distribution of classes, number of words per document, etc.

[01-get-embeddings.ipynb](https://github.com/RHEcosystemAppEng/genai-document-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/01-get-embeddings.ipynb) - This notebook uses pre-trained word embeddings to create vector representations for each document.

[02-classify-documents.ipynb](https://github.com/RHEcosystemAppEng/genai-document-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/02-classify-documents.ipynb) - This notebook builds classification models using DISTILBERT to classify each document and to predict the class of each document.

[03-extract-key-information.ipynb](https://github.com/RHEcosystemAppEng/genai-document-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/03-extract-key-information.ipynb) - This notebook extracts key information from each document such as people, organizations, locations, etc.

[04-extract-key-words.ipynb](https://github.com/RHEcosystemAppEng/genai-document-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/04-extract-key-words.ipynb) - This notebook extracts important keywords from each document.
